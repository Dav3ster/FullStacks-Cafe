## Description
This full stack application serves as an ordering system for a cafe. This MVP iteration works as an ordering app on in-house kiosks at each table, customers can select their order and send it  to the kitchen where each order can veviewd on a command line interface system. This application is scalable to become a full service online ordering website and menu page, as well as being tied in to an automated ticket printer.

## Installation
For this demonstration the application is deployed to Heroku. For full deployment in a restaurant environment, a server would be setup and connected to the ordering kiosks, as well as a terminal available to the manager or potentially tied in to the existing POS system.

## Usage
When run, the front-end acts as a menu and ordering system, customers can select their chosen dishes and beverages and checkout, which sends the order to the server. A command line interrface which is run frwith node.js from the command line byr running manager.js opens the CLI , which is passowrd protected, and allows viewing the orders.
